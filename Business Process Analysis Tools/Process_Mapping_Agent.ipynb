        "## What This Tool Does\n",
        "\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook implements an **AI-Powered Process Mapping Agent**. It takes your existing process documentation – whether it's in text format, extracted from PDFs, or copied from platforms like Confluence – and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Understand** the described process flow, steps, decisions, and sequences.\n",
        "2.  **Generate** a structured representation of that process in a diagramming language (like Mermaid.js or PlantUML).\n",
        "3.  **Visualize** the process as a clear, easy-to-understand flowchart.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, it automates the often time-consuming task of creating initial process diagrams from written materials, allowing for rapid visualization and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How This Delivers Business Value (The \"Makes Money\" Aspect)\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool isn't a direct revenue generator, but it provides significant business value that translates into cost savings, efficiency gains, improved outcomes, and ultimately, enhanced profitability. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **💰 Drastically Reduce Manual Effort & Costs:**\n",
        "    * **Save Billable Hours:** Automating diagram creation frees up valuable time for analysts, consultants, and subject matter experts who would otherwise spend hours manually drawing flowcharts. This directly translates to reduced project costs or allows resources to focus on higher-value strategic analysis.\n",
        "    * **Accelerate Project Delivery:** Quickly generate initial process maps to kickstart analysis, workshops, and improvement initiatives, leading to faster project completion and quicker realization of benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **📈 Boost Operational Efficiency:**\n",
        "    * **Rapid Process Visualization:** Quickly convert lengthy documents into clear visual maps, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and areas for optimization within your operations.\n",
        "    * **Standardized Understanding:** Ensure everyone views and understands processes consistently, reducing misinterpretations and errors that can cost time and money.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **💡 Enhance Communication & Collaboration:**\n",
        "    * **Clearer Insights:** Visual diagrams are far more intuitive and easier to discuss than text-heavy documents, leading to more productive conversations among stakeholders (business"
