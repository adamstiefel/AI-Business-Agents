        "## Goal\n",
        "To take a user-defined topic, have an AI perform web research on it, synthesize the information, and then automatically generate a concise, well-structured, one-page PowerPoint (`.pptx`) summary that can be downloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How this \"Makes Money\" (Delivers Business Value)\n",
        "\n",
        "* 🚀 **Drastically Accelerate Draft Creation:** Saves significant time and effort typically spent on initial research, content outlining, and basic slide formatting for presentations or summaries.\n",
        "* ⏱️ **Rapid Information Synthesis:** Quickly transforms broad topics or scattered information into a condensed, digestible one-page overview.\n",
        "* 📊 **Efficient Meeting & Briefing Preparation:** Generate instant pre-reads, executive summaries, or talking point slides for meetings and briefings.\n",
        "* 💡 **Content Curation & Ideation Kick-starter:** Acts as an intelligent assistant to gather, structure, and present initial information, which can then be refined for reports, articles, or further research.\n",
        "* 📢 **Quick Proposal & Idea Pitching:** Develop initial one-pagers to present ideas or proposals swiftly.\n",
        "* 🎓 **Learning & Topic Exploration Aid:** Provides a quick, structured summary for understanding the basics of a new topic.\n",
        "* 💪 **Focus Human Effort on Refinement:** Allows users to spend their time on higher-value tasks like in-depth analysis, strategic messaging, and visual polishing, rather than starting from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "**Important Notes:**\n",
        "* The \"beauty\" of the PowerPoint will be focused on a clean, professional, and readable layout generated programmatically. Advanced custom designs would typically require templates or manual editing.\n",
        "* The quality of the research and content depends on publicly available information and the LLM's capabilities.\n",
        "* This tool generates a *first draft*. Human review and refinement are essential.\n",
        "* Directly \"viewing\" the `.pptx` in Colab is not natively supported; downloading the file is the primary method.\n",
